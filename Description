This is a web application created with Python using the Flask framework. I am in the beginning stages of development, and my goal is to make it available and host it on a server. With this web app, users can perform a mass Google dork scan, and the results are securely saved in our database as well as in the user's account. I have just built a simple interface for login and sign-up, and there is more work to be done.
